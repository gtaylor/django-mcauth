django-mcauth (Broken after Minecraft auth re-vamp)
===================================================

**NOTE: It was only a matter of time until it happened, but it finally did.
This Django app no longer functions with the latest Minecraft authentication
system. I'm leaving it here in case anyone wants to adapt it once more (if
this is even possible/acceptable anymore).**

django-mcauth is a pluggable authentication back-end that lets your users
login with their Minecraft.net user/pass.

.. warning:: Authentication against Minecraft.net auth servers is not
    officially endorsed, and may cease to work at any time. Using a fallback
    authentication backend (like Django's default) will prevent complete
    failure if Notch ever decides to lock things down. Also keep in mind that
    if you run a high traffic site, you may be asked to stop hitting the
    Minecraft.net auth server.

Requirements
------------

* Django 1.2+
* Python 2.6 or 2.7 (I don't care to officially support 2.5)

Installation
------------

Add ``'mcauth.backend.MinecraftAuthServerBackend'`` to your settings.py like
so::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'mcauth.backend.MinecraftAuthServerBackend',
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    )

If you don't want to create new local Django users when someone logs in with
a valid user/pass, but doesn't already exist in the DB, you can do this in
settings.py::

    # Only existing User objects can be authenticated against.
    MCAUTH_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USERS = False
